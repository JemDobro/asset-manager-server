# Asset Inventory Manager
An app to simplify and automate the inventory management of the hardware assets of your company, allowing requestors one quick and easy place to request assets, see the status of their requests, as well as see the assets for which they are currently responsible/own.  Requestors can also cancel pending requests they no longer need, and resubmit cancelled requests should they discover they will be needing the asset after all.

## V1 Feature List
 * Users are first taken to an introductory landing page where they will find instructions and links to create an account or login.
 * Users will be automatically logged in upon successful account creation, and once logged in they are taken to their dashboard.
 * Users can see all assets they have requested and the status of each asset.
 * Users can request assets from the dashboard, and see their dashboard while they are creating their request so they can reference what information from their requests as they create new requests.
 * Users can cancel pending requests if they no longer need the requested asset.
 * Users can resubmit requests they previously cancelled should they find they do need the asset after all.
